# pi-snake

This is a snake game I wrote back in 2016 or 2017 for Raspberry Pi with a connected LED array.
Some of the implementation details appear *interesting* after a few years but it was a really satisfying project and I think it's best to just leave it as-is.
I might make a write-up about it but that's probably as far as I'm going to go with it.
